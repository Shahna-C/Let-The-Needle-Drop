# Let The Needle Drop

>Let The Needle Drop is an E-Commerce website that sells vinyl albums and novelties. 

## General info
Fullstack e-commerce website utilizing Java and Angular technologies. This website was inspired by my curiosity to see what it takes to develop a project on the front end. I am wrapping up a backend software development bootcamp and I wanted to see how I could design a REST API and see the functionality visually.
